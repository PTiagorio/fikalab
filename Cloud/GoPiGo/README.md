# GoPiGo

In this section we specify all the necessary GoPiGo files and information for our project.

## Operatig System

The operating system used in GoPiGo was Rapbian for Robots, which can be seen an installation tutorial [here](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/install-raspbian-for-robots-image-on-an-sd-card/).

## Files

The files in this folder are responsible for GoPiGo's movement locally, each representing a different direction (in the case of left and right it simply turns).
